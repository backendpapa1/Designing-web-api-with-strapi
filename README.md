# Designing-web-api-with-strapi


## Intro
hey guys, its papi here, in this course i will teach you how to build and design web apis using headless CMS, in this context? ```Strapi```.
## Understanding headless CMS
- A CMS is a software application used for web development that allows users to create, edit, and publish content.
- Traditional CMS like drupal, Wordpress puts all contents(images, html & css) in one place making it hard to reuse components.
- Headless CMS is a backend content management system decoupled from the ```presentation layer``` which means it allows you to manage your contents in one place.
- Whatever changes you make reflects in the presentation layer compared to a traditional cms which is tightly coupled together.
#### Example
Lets assume its christmas and you want to update your logo. A tightly coupled traditional CMS won't give you that ease of work as you will have to sort it out since they are all in one bucket.

Assuming PERSON A have a bucket full of clothes specifically shirts and a trousers. blue shirt story, takes more time because:
- you have to sort the clothes into shirts and trousers.
- then you focus on the shirts and you try to find the blue shirt

PERSON B have two buckets one for shirt and the other for trousers.
- Its easier for PERSON B who goes stright to the bucket with shirts nd find the blue shirt.

Difference between PERSON A and B is 
- Ease
- Time wasted
- Accessibility
